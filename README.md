## Code for training a neural network model as a binary “yes/no” classifier model using Jupyter Notebook

1. Installation

pip install notebook

3. Create a folder for the project
 
project's name

5. Create a datase folder

projetc's dataset

7. Inside the dataset folder create 2 folders "positive" and "negative"
   
Inside these folders place the images with which the model will be trained.

9. Run the notebook:
   
Inside project's folder cmd:

jupyter notebook

11. Download the file simple_neural_network and open it o create e new file: New -> Python 3 (ipykernel)
 . 1st cell is for training the model
 . 2nd cell is for making inference
