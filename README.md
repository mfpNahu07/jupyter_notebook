## Code for training a neural network model as a binary “yes/no” classifier model using Jupyter Notebook

**1. Installation**

  pip install notebook

**2. Create a folder for the project**
 
  project's name

**3. Create a datase folder**

  projetc's dataset

**4. Inside the dataset folder create 2 folders "positive" and "negative"**
   
  Inside these folders place the images with which the model will be trained.

**5. Run the notebook:**
   
  Inside project's folder cmd:

  jupyter notebook

**6. Download the file simple_neural_network and open it o create e new file: New -> Python 3 (ipykernel)**

   . 1st cell is for training the model
 
   . 2nd cell is for making inference
